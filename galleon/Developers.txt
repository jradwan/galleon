Notes for Galleon Developers
============================

After sending an email request to become a Galleon developer to
javahmo@users.sourceforge.net, you will also be added to two mailing lists:
galleon-developers@lists.sourceforge.net: used for developer issues,
galleon-commits@lists.sourceforge.net: used by CVS to automatically post all checkins.
Both these mailing lists are archived on the project development page.

To help us keep track of who is doing what, we use the project bug and feature trackers. 
If you want to fix a particular bug or implement a feature, assign it to yourself. If there 
are any new features you want to work on, go ahead and add new features to the tracker. 
If you decide to do any significant development changes to JavaHMO it is recommended that 
you use the mailing list to get feedback first.

I suggest that you read through the developer documentation provided by Sourceforge. 
Everything you will need to know to use CVS and the project tools are explained in detail.


Building
--------
Galleon uses JDK 1.5

Ant build scripts are used to manage the build process (http://ant.apache.org).  
To compile the galleon.jar file:
ant compile

To build the Galleon package:
ant package


Running
-------

Use the scripts in the bin directory to run the configuration GUI and
Galleon server.


Coding Style
------------
The Java code should conform to the Sun Java Coding conventions. The only modification of the convention is that lines 
up to 120 characters are allowed instead of the standard 80 characters.
