Winamp skins:
The project has permission from the author of the Metrix Winamp classic skins (Sven Kistner) to distribute the skins with the Galleon project:
http://www.winamp.com/skins/browse.php?search=yes&filter=S&query=metrix
However, for copyright reasons, the skins are not checked into the project CVS. The Galleon build script will add any *.wsz Winamp skin files
that are in the media/winamp directory to a package build. The Galleon GUI will detect any *.wsz files that are in the media/winamp directory and will 
allow the user to pick a skin in the music app configuration screen.

Download your favorite Winamp Classic skin from: http://www.winamp.com/skins
The following skin is recommended: http://www.winamp.com/skins/details.php?id=35567

(If you have Winamp installed, then don't click on the Download button on
the Winamp page; rather use the right-click menu to do a Save As of the
file)


Music Player:
Basic operations such as Play, Pause, Next, Previous and Stop are supported in this version:
Play = Play
Pause = Pause
Slow = Stop
Channel Up = Next
Channel Down = Previous
