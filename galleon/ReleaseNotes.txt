Your TiVo needs to be running version 7.1 software.
On your TiVo DVR:

   1. Turn on HME. Navigate to System Information and press the following four keys in order : CLEAR CLEAR 0 0. Ignore the sounds.
   2. Return to TiVo Central. Note that Music and Photos changed to Music, Photos and More.
   3. Enter Music, Photos and More. 


Known issues:

1. The server needs to be running for the configuration GUI to work.
2. Most JavaHMO plugins have been ported to Galleon yet.
3. HME apps are deployed in the Galleon apps directory. The readme.txt file contains instructions for the Winamp player.
4. Galleon requires JDK 1.5
5. Sections of code have been commented out until all of the JavaHMO code is ported.
6. Weather errors arent handled properly.
7. Weather web links need parameters.
8. Weather app removal does not work.
9. Cannot determine TiVo's automatically.
10. Weather currently only uses zip.
11. Weather alerts do not show all text.
12. When you start Galleon, it might take some time before the ToGo list is populated.


How to get started:
1. Run the Galleon configuration GUI using the gui.cmd script in the bin directory.
2. Configure the ToGo recordings path and media access key using the File/Properties menu.
3. Use the File/ToGo menu to add your TiVo IP address. (Ignore any warning messages)
4. Click on the recordings tab and wait for the GUI to download the list of recordings.
5. Exit from the GUI.
6. If you want to run the Winamp player, follow the intructions in the apps Readme.txt file.
7. Run the Galleon server by using the run.cmd script in the bin directory. 
Wait until you see a message about the ToGo app being registered.
