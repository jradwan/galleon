Galleon

Version 0.0.0 beta 2:

ToGo improvements.


Version 0.0.0 beta 1:
---------------------
Your TiVo needs to be running version 7.1 software.
On your TiVo DVR:

   1. Turn on HME. Navigate to System Information and press the following four keys in order : CLEAR CLEAR 0 0. Ignore the sounds.
   2. Return to TiVo Central. Note that Music and Photos changed to Music, Photos and More.
   3. Enter Music, Photos and More. The samples should be listed.


Known issues:

1. GUI does not update server immediately. After making any changes in the GUI, restart the server.
2. No JavaHMO plugins have been ported to Galleon yet.
3. HME apps are deployed in the Galleon apps directory. The readme.txt file contains instructions for the Winamp player.
4. Galleon requires JDK 1.5
5. Sections of code have been commented out until all of the JavaHMO code is ported.
6. The HME ToGo app does not update the status of the recordings when the server starts downloading. You have to exit the app to get the
status of the shows updated properly.


How to get started:
1. Run the Galleon configuration GUI using the gui.cmd script in the bin directory.
2. Configure the ToGo recordings path and media access key using the File/Properties menu.
3. Use the File/ToGo menu to add your TiVo IP address. (Ignore any warning messages)
4. Click on the recordings tab and wait for the GUI to download the list of recordings.
5. Exit from the GUI.
6. If you want to run the Winamp player, follow the intructions in the apps Readme.txt file.
7. Run the Galleon server by using the run.cmd script in the bin directory. 
Wait until you see a message about the ToGo app being registered.
8. Use your TiVo to pick ToGo recordings to download to your PC.


One note for folks installing JDK 1.5 for the first time - when launching Galleon you may get the following error:

Code:

D:\galleon\bin>run.cmd Error: no `server' JVM at `C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_01\bin\server\jvm.dll'

The default 1.5 install puts the "server" subfolder under ...Java\jdk1.5.0_01 \bin\server\...
Just copy the server subfolder that is under the jdk...\bin path and put it under the jre....\bin path. This is the recommended fix from Sun.
