  src/org/lnicholls/galleon/Server/Constants.java
  conf/configure.xml.default
  distro/osx/....

* Scripting of install library list
* OSX installer

* Clean up non-MacOS stuff, confirm paths for Java 5 are set up right in scripts

  GALLEON_2_4_0_skin_branch), merge it into main trunk branch

HD stuff:

* Improve layout, backgrounds of HD weather, music, etc.
