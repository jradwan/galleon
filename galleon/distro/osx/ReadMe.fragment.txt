IMPORTANT: Stop any running Galleon server before starting this installation.

After installation, run /Applications/Galleon/Galleon Server.  Give it a
minute, then run /Applications/Galleon/Configure Galleon.

IMPORTANT: upgrade from 2.4.0 alpha will put the target
applications to a new subdirectory of applications: /Applications/Galleon/

If you are upgrading from 2.4.0 alpha, please run Galleon Server.app
after install, and then Configure Galleon.app, and 
verify the configuration.  You also need to set the server properties
so that the configure.xml is properly set up for the new
application location.  
To do this in Configure Galleon, select File->Properties
and toggle the skin to the other settings and back to what you want,
then click "OK" and then exit Configure Galleon.

After you confirm your new server installation is working, drag
      /Applications/Configure Galleon.app 
and
      /Applications/Galleon Server.app 
to the trash.
