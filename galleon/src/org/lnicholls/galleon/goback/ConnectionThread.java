 *
 * Normally, TCP beacons are exchanged between two specific TCMs, one TCM initiating the connection on port 2190. With
 * the IP address (typically supplied by a user) associated with some "target" TCM, the initiating TCM establishes a TCP
 * connection with the target TCM and then transmits a single packet. The target TCM responds with its own packet. From
 * this point on, the connection is maintained (normally "quiet", with no additional packets sent) until either TCM
 * drops the connection. Although TCP beacons need only be exchanged once upon initial connection, each TCM should be
 * prepared to accept and process redundant packets from the other, just as with broadcast-based discovery. 3.5 Update
 * Procedure When any information about a TCM changes, the affected TCM should switch back to highfrequency mode (again
 * for 30 seconds, just as upon startup) broadcasting several packets containing the new information. This will allow
 * the changes to propagate quickly to any other TCMs participating in broadcast-based discovery. In order to also
 * propagate the changes to those TCMs participating in connection-based discovery, a single packet containing the new
 * information should also be sent to each currently connected TCM (regardless of whether the affected TCM initiated the
 * connection or not).
